PlaceholderBlocks - temporary blocks while you wait

Allows you to easily register arbitrary block IDs + metadata in Minecraft. Includes a handful of programmer art textures (or you can reuse other textures).

Configurable to support any number of block IDs, metadata, textures, and names. See default config/PlaceholderBlocks.cfg for an example, tweaked to a subset of RedPower2-compatible FTB Ultimate block IDs (world only).

Open sourced under the BSD License, pull requests, forks, redistribution, etc. welcome.

Build with:

    mvn initialize -P -built
