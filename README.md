PlaceholderBlocks - temporary blocks while you wait

Allows you to easily register arbitrary block IDs + metadata in Minecraft. 
Includes a handful of programmer art textures (or you can reuse other textures).

Configurable to support any number of block IDs, metadata, textures, and names.

By default, no blocks are registered. It is up to you to edit config/PlaceholderBlocks.cfg
and add the blocks you want. Or you can use a pre-existing example:

* [Example 1](https://github.com/agaricusb/PlaceholderBlocks/blob/master/examples/example1.txt) - placeholders for RedPower2 world gen blocks matching FTB Ultimate block IDs
